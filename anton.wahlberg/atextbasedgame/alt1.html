          Climbing is cumbersome. The tree you chose had an extra thick layer
          of moss and your skills have definitely faltered since your youngster
          days. You reach the top though, panting.

          Wow, this place is amasing, and I can see very far from here, however
          there isn't really anything more than trees, and even more trees on
          top of that. Now I have to get down again somehow...
